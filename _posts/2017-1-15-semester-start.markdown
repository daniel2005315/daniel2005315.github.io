Another new start!

It's been a year since I switched to study CS, now that I have completed plenty of major required courses, I am catching up quick and I can start taking some more advanced topics as electives. Other than some other maths and statistics courses, the main focus for me in this semester will be:

<ul>
<li>Principle of Computer Game Software</li>
<li>Data Communication and Computer Networks</li>
<li>Data Structures</li>
</ul>

 I am so excited that I can do some game development on Unity with my partner from last semester this time.

Besides, I have some plans in mind for development a 2D adventure game as a side project, if I have any progress, I will post it up here.

Anyway, got to focus on my study first!
